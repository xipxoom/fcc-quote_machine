# fcc-quote_machine
Random quote machine project for Free Code Camp.

## Description
It's time to begin the intermediate front end development projects for [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com).  This task is to [build a random quote machine](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine).
The task doesn't specify how the quotes are to be retrieved but some remote API access via ajax fits with the spirit of the challenge.

## Objective:
Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functional similar to [the example](http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELoPJ).

### Rules:
1. Don't look at the example project's code.  Figure it out for yourself.
2. Fulfill the below [user stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story).  Use whichever libraries or APIs you need.  Give it your own personal style.

### User Stories:
* I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
* I can press a button to tweet out a quote.
